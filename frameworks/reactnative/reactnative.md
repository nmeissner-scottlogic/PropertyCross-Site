This is an implementation of the PropertyCross application using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) enables development of iOS and Android applications using the 'React' Javascript framework. The framework provides built-in Javascript components which are backed by actual native Android and iOS components that give the app a very convincing native feel.
React Native development focuses around the idea of 'Learn once, write anywhere'. The idea comes from being able to write platform specific UIs without having to learn a fundamentally different set of technologies to develop for each platform.

This project is based on Colin Eberhardt's Property Finder. You can read about his experience writing Property Finder in [this blog](https://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript).
